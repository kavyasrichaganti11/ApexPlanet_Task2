    <h2>About LearnSphere</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>LearnSphere</strong> is a community-driven educational platform built to support students in rural areas with personalized and accessible learning resources. 
      Born out of a survey conducted in Rural Areas, the project aims to bridge the gap between traditional education and modern learning tools.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Why LearnSphere?</h3>
    <p>
      During our field research, we discovered that many students lacked proper access to structured online resources. 
      LearnSphere addresses this by offering curated lectures, handwritten notes, subject-wise guides, and project tutorials—all in one place. 
      This makes it easier for learners to find what they need without wasting time searching across multiple platforms.
    </p>
  
    <h3>What Does It Offer?</h3>
    <p>
      The platform features a powerful content hub, personalized lesson planning tools, assessment modules, and even a learner’s network. 
      Students can track their progress, take quizzes, and connect with peers to exchange notes and ideas. 
      Additionally, LearnSphere integrates YouTube video links and notes prepared by university students to enrich the learning experience.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Who Is It For?</h3>
    <p>
      LearnSphere is specially designed for students from rural and semi-urban backgrounds who may not have access to premium educational apps. 
      It simplifies learning by removing technical barriers and focuses on easy navigation, language flexibility, and practical content.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Our vision is to create an inclusive digital ecosystem where every learner, regardless of location, can reach their full potential.
